= Jaeger

Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, including:

* Distributed context propagation
* Distributed transaction monitoring
* Root cause analysis
* Service dependency analysis
* Performance / latency optimization

= Components
Jaeger can be deployed either as all-in-one binary, where all Jaeger backend components run in a single process, or as a scalable distributed system, discussed below. There are two main deployment options:

* Collectors are writing directly to storage.
* Collectors are writing to Kafka as a preliminary buffer
